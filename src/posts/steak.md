I'm going to make an argument for cooking steak in an air fryer.

1. Turn the air fryer up as hot as possible.
2. Put it on for 10 minutes to preheat.
3. Get a steak out. Doesn't matter if it's frozen. Whatever.
4. Dry it off with a paper towel if you can.
5. Put some salt on it if you want.
6. Chuck it in the air fryer and cook it as hot as you can.
7. Check it after about four minutes to make sure you don't cook the fuck out of it.
8. Flip it over. Maybe four to five to six minutes if it's frozen.
9. Then tell me I'm not crazy.
