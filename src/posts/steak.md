I'm going to make an argument for cooking steak in an air fryer.

## Requirements

- You know how to cook a steak.

## Steps

1. Turn the air fryer up as hot as possible.
2. Preheat it for about 10 minutes.
3. Get a steak out. Doesn't matter if it's frozen.
4. Dry it off with a paper towel if you can.
5. Put some salt on it if you want.
6. Chuck it in the air fryer.
7. Check it after about four minutes, depending on how it's looking.
8. You may or may not flip it.
9. Cook it for probably another four minutes.
10. If it's a thick steak, maybe give it another two minutes a side.
11. If it's a thin steak, it's probably ready to rock, brother.
