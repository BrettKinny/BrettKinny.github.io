This is my personal blog. I built it with Eleventy, a static site generator that spits out plain HTML files. No database, no server-side code, no complexity. Just markdown files that become web pages.

I went with a minimal textual design because I like how it looks. Clean lines, nothing flashy. It's minimal on purpose. No tracking, no analytics, no cookies, no bullshit. The site loads fast because there's nothing to load.

Static sites have been around forever, but they're having a moment again. The appeal is obvious: they're fast, secure, cheap to host, and simple to deploy. Write some content, build the site, push to GitHub Pages or Netlify, and you're done. No maintaining servers, no worrying about database security, no scaling problems.

I'll write about whatever I feel like here. Probably some web development stuff since that's what I do. Maybe some opinions on tools and workflows. Maybe random thoughts about things that have nothing to do with code. The beauty of a personal blog is you don't have to stick to a niche.

The design philosophy is simple: content first, everything else second. If something doesn't serve the words on the page, it doesn't belong here. White space isn't wasted space. Restraint is a feature. Every element should earn its place.

That's it. That's the blog. Thanks for reading.
