Welcome to my personal developer blog! I've built this site with [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/), a simple and powerful static site generator.

## Why 11ty?

I chose 11ty for a few key reasons:

- **Simplicity**: No complex framework overhead
- **Flexibility**: Use any templating language you prefer
- **Performance**: Generates fast, static HTML
- **Control**: Full control over the output

## The Design Philosophy

This site embraces a **TUI-inspired aesthetic** - think terminal windows and command-line interfaces, but refined and minimal. The design uses:

- Monospace fonts throughout
- A dark, low-contrast color scheme
- Terminal-style prefixes (`$`, `#`, `>`)
- Clean borders and structured layouts

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing thoughts on:

- Web development best practices
- JavaScript and modern frameworks
- Build tools and workflows
- Developer productivity tips

Stay tuned for more posts!
