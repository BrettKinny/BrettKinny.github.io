This is my personal blog. I built it with Eleventy, a static site generator. Markdown files go in, HTML comes out. No database, no server-side code.

The design is minimal on purpose. No tracking, no analytics, no bullshit. It loads fast because there's nothing to load.

I'm an automation engineer. I'll write about industrial automation, the tools I use, and whatever else.
